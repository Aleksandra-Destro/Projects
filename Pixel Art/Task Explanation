# Task Result

I am currently studying frontend development and decided to participate in the challenge. 

## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript

I don't have experience with JS libraries or frameworks, so I used pure JavaScript.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I decided to focus on functionality and live design as simple as possible, so I did not use 3rd party librabries.

## Installation / Run

To run the project locally, just copy the repository and open html file in Chrome or Firefox:

```console
$ git clone <linktorepository>
```
